Looking at the new customers, a majority of them took up the promotional offer, 'Offer E', which suggests that this promotion is effective.
However, majority of the customers(89.87%) are on month-to-month contract, which poses a higher risk for the new customers to churn in the coming months.
Top 3 services that has been subscribed are phone service, internet and unlimited data.

We have identified that the top 3 cities with the highest churn are San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, which contributes to the large percentage of the overall churn figures. As for the reasons, we have derived that competitors, which have better offers/devices, has contributed to customers from leaving the company. Another reason that has caused churn seems to come from the bad services provided by the support personnels, which also has to be addressed.


#Recommendations
It is important to keep up with competitive pricing with their competitors in order to retain customers. It is recommended that the company to conduct market research to identify their competitors' pricing and to craft out a similar or better offer in order to attract/retain the customers. As unlimited data is one of the top services subscribed, it is ideal to include unlimited data in the contract plans which is likely to be able to attract more customers. As for the support personnels, proper trainings should be conducted in order to ensure great customer support.
